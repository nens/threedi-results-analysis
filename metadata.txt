about=Analyse 3Di results and visualize computational grids in the 3Di Modeller Interface.

    The tools that this plugin provides allow you to:

    - Make (maximum) water depth or water level rasters from raw 3Di simulation results.
    - Visualize results on the map canvas for a specific timestep
    - Plot timeseries of discharge, water level or any other variable in a graph
    - Make side view plots of water levels and water level gradients at any time during the simulation
    - Calculate the water balance for any given area in the model domain
    - Calculate aggregated results such as maximum water level per node or total discharge per flowline
    - Calculate the total discharge crossing a user-defined line
    - Find the upstream or downstream area for any node or group of nodes


    This plugin replaces the 3Di Toolbox plugin. See the transition guide: https://docs.3di.live/i_transition_from_3di_toolbox.html
